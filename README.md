## Framework

Django stands as a professional and high-level Python web framework, admired for its simplicity, versatility, and adherence to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) and "Convention Over Configuration" (CoC) principles. Offering a powerful and batteries-included environment, Django provides a robust Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, an intuitive templating engine, and a dynamic admin interface. Its MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture facilitates clean code organization, while built-in features like automatic admin generation, URL routing, and authentication simplify development tasks. Django's emphasis on security, scalability, and rapid development, along with its vibrant community and extensive documentation, makes it a go-to framework for developers aiming to build sophisticated and maintainable web applications.
